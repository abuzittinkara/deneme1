# API Versioning and Database Migration Guide

This document outlines the strategies for API versioning, database migrations, and rollback procedures in the Fisqos project.

## API Versioning

### Strategy
- Use URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`).
- Increment the version number for breaking changes.
- Maintain backward compatibility for at least one version.

### Implementation
1. Define versioned routes in the `routes/` directory (e.g., `routes/v1/`, `routes/v2/`).
2. Use middleware to route requests to the appropriate version.
3. Document API changes in `API.md`.

### Deprecation Policy
- Announce deprecations in advance.
- Provide a migration guide for clients.
- Remove deprecated versions after a grace period.

## Database Migrations

### Tools
- Use a migration tool like `migrate-mongo` or `sequelize-cli`.
- Store migration scripts in the `migrations/` directory.

### Workflow
1. Create a new migration script:

   ```bash
   migrate-mongo create migration-name
   ```

2. Edit the script to define `up` and `down` methods for applying and rolling back changes.
3. Run the migration:

   ```bash
   migrate-mongo up
   ```

4. Test the migration in a staging environment before applying it to production.

### Rollback
- Use the `down` method in migration scripts to revert changes:

  ```bash
  migrate-mongo down
  ```

- Test rollbacks in a staging environment.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Commit migration scripts to the repository.
- **Testing**: Test migrations and rollbacks in isolated environments.
- **Documentation**: Document schema changes and their impact.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor database performance after applying migrations.
